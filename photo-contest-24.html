<h1>Welcome to Aaron's Annual Marvelous Photo Contest 3 (2024)</h1>
<div class="notice-box"><h2>SUBMISSION DUE DATE IS: Nov. 26th</h2></div><br>
<div class="boxes">
    <h3>First things first, Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>As usual, one picture for each prompt.</li>
        <li>Any camera is allowed this time, whatever you're comfortable with you can use. If it captures light and can be translated to a digital format, it counts</li>
        <li>Because of our <i>unique</i> judges this time around, you are no longer constrained by the time at which the picture was taken.
            As long as you were the individual to take the picture and you think it fits the category, it's a valid entry.</li>
        <li>Once you're satisfied with your picture submissions, please email them to me by, at the latest <b>Nov 26th</b> in a zip file with each
            picture labeled as its corresponding number in the prompt list.</li>
        <li>This should not have to be mentioned but for clarity: You have to physically take the picture.  No AI and no post processing should be done to modify or create the images.</li>
    </ul>
</div><br>
<div class="boxes">
    <h3>Finally, the prompt list</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
                <li><b>Aquatic</b> (Fish, body of water, water feature, your sink, whatever)</li>
                <li><b>Picture of words</b> (Think street sign, newspaper, textbook)</li>
                <li><b>Fridge picture</b> (I wrote this down last year and I have no clue what it means, intrepret how you want)</li>
                <li><b>Trash</b> (Do I mean a trash quality picture or trash subject? Up to the judges)</li>
                <li><b>A Pattern or A Fractal or something geometric</b> (Anything that is a pattern, a fractal, or entirely geometric)</li>
                <li><b>Sparkles, Glowing, Luminscence</b> (Anything that sparkles, glows, or is luminescent)</li>
