<h3>Why does this website exist?</h3>
<p>
  Hello there! My name is Aaron & I'm a KSU IT-Cybersecurity student and this website is for my Advanced Web & Mobile App Development Class, Specifically IT4403 with Professor Stevie Prettyman.<br>
  <a href="https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/it/">Here</a> is a link to Kennesaw's Department of Information Technology website.<br>
  And <a href="https://github.com/aharbin5/aharbin5.github.io">Here</a> is a link to the github respository that this site is run from.

  <h3>Note:</h3>
  <p>Microsoft Azure doesn't allow you to use your own domain unless you pay them a monthly fee to do it.
  I refuse to pay for something I can do for free, so some labs are going to be a link to the page on the azure website.
  So most of the simple stuff will be a html document saved and hosted through github pages, but the complex things will be
  hosted on the Azure.<br>
  Thank you for understanding.</p>
